# Library
Library project from The Odin Project

Project goal was to create a small library with the ability to add and remove books
In the project, I created a book factory to create new book objects, I've also wrote a few basic tests to the the factory function.

Although optional, I've hosted the project on firebase and used firestore to store the books currently saved in the library
